		 * syncInfo will contain synchronization data for CLIENTSYNCEVENT events, otherwise null.
		 * 
		 * Contained properties include (see Ethereum.onMonitorSyncStatus):
		 * 		status (Number): -2 means connecting to peers/network, -1 means waiting for first sync message, 1 means syncing, 
		 * 					and 2 means fully synched (awaiting new blocks)
		 * 		statusText (String): A human-readable text version of the status.
		 * 		percentComplete (Number): The synchronization percentage that has completed.
		 *  	percentRemaining (Number): The synchronization percentage that is remaining.
		 *      blocksRemaining (Number): The number of blocks remaining to synchronize. Refer to the web3.eth.syncing object for additional 
		 * 					synchronization details.
		 * 		blocksPerSecond (Number): The average number of blocks transferred per second during the last sync status check.
		 * 		averageBlocksPerSecond (Number): The smoothed average number of blocks transferred, defined as: 
		 * 					averageBlocksPerSecond = (blocksPerSecond + averageBlocksPerSecond) / 2
